# Emre Eymen Varcı - Unity Scripting Project
This is the sheep rescue game I've developed by following the tutorial. Here are the changes I've made:
- Added a second snowy level.
	- The player can reach 5 rescued sheeps to continue to the level 2.
	- I've added a very simple fade in/out animation when changing levels.
	- Assets used: 
		- Winter Forest - Low Poly Toon Battle Arena / Tower Defense Pack (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/winter-forest-low-poly-toon-battle-arena-tower-defense-pack-150432)
		- Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153)
- Added powerup sheeps.
	- Every once in a while, a glowing ship will spawn. 
	- If the player hits the glowing ship, they get powerups.
		- Speed up 
		- Higher shooting speed
	- While the user has power up, they also start to glow.
